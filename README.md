# Missing Number

The repo implements a function, whose parameters are two lists, and returns an element in either the first or second list 
but no in both. The implementation is guided by these [tests](test/missingnumbertest.py).

## Why am I doing this?

These labs are part of the Andela boot-camp set of programming assignments, which am currently participating in.

Feel free to comment on the code or ask any questions about the boot-camp.
